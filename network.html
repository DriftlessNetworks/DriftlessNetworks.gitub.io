        <h2 class="font-weight-light">Network Security</h2>
          <p>Cybersecurity is a major concern for all businesses. We can help you with evaluating and responding to potential threats, which is a growing concern for a lot of businesses.</p>
          <p>When it comes to network security, it is easy for small to medium sized businesses to fall into a false sence of secuirty thinking the hackers "are only after the big guys.”
            The reality is that attacks on all sizes of networks have been increasing year after year as hackers have become more sophisticated, and small businesses are being affected every day by relaxed or non-existent security policies.</p>

            <p>A 2013 study showed that 1 in every 5 small businesses' networks would be compromised. With the ever-increasing technological advances, it is likely that since then, these numbers have climbed, posing a significant risk for a potential breach, lost or stolen data, or some type of malicious threat.</p>

            <p>There are a number of ways Driftless Networks helps to ensure that you are at minimum risk:</p>

               <li>Updates - Keeping computers and network equipment updated is one of the most effective steps to preventing a possible network security issue.</li>
               <li>Firewall - A common mistake in small to medium business networks is the lack of a business grade firewall solution. Often business owners are unaware of the difference between having a network router and having a network firewall in place.</li>
               <li>Passwords - Password and password protection are proving to be an area that needs attention when discussing network security. Using sophisticated software and tools, hackers are easily gaining access to small business networks through simple or default passwords.</li>
               <li>Antivirus/Antispam - Most people know that antivirus and antispam software are necessary components of network security, but many people don’t realize why it's so important until their computer or network is infected with a virus, malware, spyware, or a host of other potentially dangerous issues.</li>
               <li>Data Backups - In case the worse does happen, having backups of your essencial data can help you quickly recover in the case of a catastrophic breach. In some cases hackers have been known to encrypt a users data and demand a ransom in exchange for the key to unlock their data.
              Even when victims pay the ransom, sometimes they still don't get their data back. Having multiple current backups can help with this type of threat as well as more traditonal losses such as hard drive failure, theft, fire or storm damage.

            <p>No matter the size of your business, network security is a definite requirement for every business in the digital age. If you are worried or unsure of where to start with an internal security audit, our team can help get you on track.</p>
          </br>
